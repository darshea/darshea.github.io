Toggle: The Task Management System

Conceived in 2022 while I was employed part-time at a boutique law firm, Toggle was inspired by a clear need. I observed the limitations of using Excel checklists to manage and share tasks among part-time colleagues. The back and forth exchange of recurring tasks within a single spreadsheet revealed the pressing need for an application like Toggle.

1. Quantitative Task Management
From observing countless projects go off-track, I understood a fundamental truth: what gets measured, gets managed. With Toggle, whether you're handling a recurring task or a major project, you always have clear metrics indicating your progress.

2. Intuitive User Interface
At its core, every task can be distilled into two states: incomplete (0) or complete (1). This binary approach inspired our use of toggles. And to organize these tasks? A simple, familiar structure: folders. Drawing inspiration from the universally recognized file management systems, like that of Windows OS, we aimed for a system that feels second-nature to users.

3. Essential Functionality for Task Management
Every task comes with a deadline. With Toggle, set a date and seamlessly integrate it with your calendar. At a glance, view your tasks sorted by their due dates.

4. Collaborative Capabilities
Enhance your workflow by sharing your workspace with peers.

Toggle is presently in the production phase, with its inaugural launch slated for mid-2024.
